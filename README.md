# Synopsis

Advanced React Redux starter Kit should show an possible solution how Application Developer and Ui-Developer can work together in a way that concerns are addressed appropriately. The user interface developer concentrates on the look and feel and creates React Components. The Application developer concentrates on business logic and uses theses React Components and "connects" them with redux

#Motivation

Many teams and projects using React and/or Redux are mixing UI and Application logic. I dont think this is a good idea. Since react and finally redux are born, I think we need a new way to approach Ui and Application logic.

This project should show that it is possible to sepearte the tasks and address the responsibilies appropiately
